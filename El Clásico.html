El Clásico is the name given in football to any match between Real Madrid <span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>and Barcelona. 
<div>Originally it referred only to those competitions held in the Spanish championship, but nowadays – in order to satisfy marketing needs – the term has been generalized, and tends to include every single match between the two clubs: UEFA Champions League, Copa del Rey, etc. Other than the UEFA Champions League Final, it is the most followed club football match in the world, watched by hundreds of millions of people.[2 </div>
