<div style="font-size:12pt;">YEARS LATER he would say that when he’d decided to become a professional baseball player, it was the only time he’d done something just for the money, and that he’d never do something just for the money ever again. He would never again let the market dictate the direction of his life.</div>
</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">Billy had come to believe that baseball scouting was at roughly the same stage of development in the twenty-first century as professional medicine had been in the eighteenth.</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“You don’t change guys,” says Billy. “They are who they are.”</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">

<div style="font-size:12pt;">The half that was in stayed in. He didn’t quit baseball. He kept grinding his way up through the minor leagues, propelled by his private fears and other people’s dreams. The difference between who he was, and who other people thought he should be, grew by the day.</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-20 11:03:19</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">Billy was entering what was meant to be his prime as a baseball player, and he’d decided he’d rather watch than play. “I always say that I loved playing the game but I’m not sure that I really did,” he said. “I never felt comfortable.”</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-20 14:28:03</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">The approach had three rules:<br/>
1. Every batter needs to behave like a leadoff man, and adopt as his main goal getting on base.<br/>
2. Every batter should also possess the power to hit home runs, in part because home run power forced opposing pitchers to pitch more cautiously, and led to walks, and high on-base percentages.<br/>
3. To anyone with the natural gifts to become a professional baseball player, hitting was less a physical than a mental skill. Or, at any rate, the aspects of hitting that could be taught were mental.</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-21 09:20:48</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">Baseball marriages were like that: their most vulnerable moment was immediately after a player retired, and it dawned on husband and wife that they’d actually be spending time together. “They end when the career ends,” said Billy. “Until then you can put up with anything because you’re always leaving the next day.”</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-21 09:24:33</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">The new, outsider’s view of baseball was all about exposing the illusions created by the insiders on the field. Billy Beane had himself been one of those illusions.</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-21 09:31:23</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">“Billy shed every one of his player-type prejudices and adapted,” Alderson said. “Whereas most of the people like him would have said, ‘That’s not the way we did it when I played.’”</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em;">
<div style="font-size:10pt; margin-bottom:1em;padding-left: 8px;border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0);color:#888888;">2014-11-21 09:35:26</div>
<div style="font-size:12pt;">For his part, Billy Beane had never heard of Bill James. “But that was the big moment,” he said, “when I figured out that all the stuff Sandy was talking about was just derivative of Bill James.” His mind had finally found an escape hatch. It led to a green field as far away from professional baseball as you could get and still be inside the park.</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">I didn’t care about the statistics in anything else. I didn’t, and don’t pay attention to statistics on the stock market, the weather, the crime rate, the gross national product, the circulation of magazines, the ebb and flow of literacy among football fans and how many people are going to starve to death before the year 2050 if I don’t start adopting them for $3.69 a month; just baseball. Now why is that? It is because baseball statistics, unlike the statistics in any other area, have acquired the powers of language.<br/>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“Every form of strength is also a form of weakness,” he once wrote. “Pretty girls tend to become insufferable because, being pretty, their faults are too much tolerated. Possessions entrap men, and wealth paralyzes them. I learned to write because I am one of those people who somehow cannot manage the common communications of smiles and gestures, but must use words to get across things that other people would never need to say.”</div>

<div style="padding-top:1em; padding-bottom:1em; border-bottom:1px dotted lightgray;">

<div style="font-size:12pt;">A talent for avoiding obvious failure was no great trait in a big league baseball player; the easiest way not to make an error was to be too slow to reach the ball in the first place. After all, wrote James, “you have to do something right to get an error; even if the ball is hit right at you, then you were standing in the right place to begin with.”</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“Managers tend to pick a strategy that is least likely to fail rather than pick a strategy that is most efficient,” said Palmer. “The pain of looking bad is worse than the gain of making the best move.”</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“The people who run baseball are surrounded by people trying to give them advice,” said James. “So they’ve built very effective walls to keep out anything.”</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">At one point Chris Pittaro said that the thing that struck him about Billy—what set him apart from most baseball insiders—was his desire to find players unlike himself. Billy Beane had gone looking for, and found, his antitheses. Young men who failed the first test of looking good in a uniform. Young men who couldn’t play anything but baseball. Young men who had gone to college.</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“The important thing is not to recreate the individual,” Billy Beane would later say. “The important thing is to recreate the aggregate.” He couldn’t and wouldn’t find another Jason Giambi; but he could find the pieces of Giambi he could least afford to be without, and buy them for a tiny fraction of the cost of Giambi himself.</div>

<div style="font-size:12pt;">“The difference between 1–2 and 2–1 in terms of expected outcomes is just enormous,” says Paul. “It’s the largest variance of expected outcomes of any one pitch. On 2–1 most average major league hitters become all-stars, yet on 1–2 they become anemic nine-hole hitters. People talk about first-pitch strikes. But it’s really the first two out of three.”</div>

3. “Know exactly what every player in baseball is worth to you. You can put a dollar figure on it.”<br/>
4. “Know exactly who you want and go after him.” (Never mind who they say they want to trade.)<br/>
