My bow, the Gāṇḍīv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.</div><div><br/></div><div> O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?</div><div><br/></div><div>Shree Krishna then moves on to the topic of social responsibilities.  He reminds Arjun of his duty as a warrior, which is to fight for upholding righteousness.  He explains that the performance of one’s social duty is a virtuous act that will open to him the stairway to the celestial abodes, while dereliction of duty will only bring him humiliation and infamy. </div><div><br/></div><div> Having motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna moves deeper into the science of work.  He asks Arjun to work without attachment to the fruits of his actions.</div><div> He terms the science of working without desire for rewards as buddhi-yog, or yog of the intellect.  The intellect must be used to restrain the mental yearning for the rewards of work.  By acting in such consciousness, bondage-creating karmas will be transformed into bondage-breaking karmas, and Arjun will attain the state beyond sorrows. </div><div><br/></div><div> I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am your disciple, and am surrendered to you. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me.</div><div><br/></div><div> The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div> O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div> Neither of them is in knowledge—the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.</div><div><br/></div><div>Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it.</div><div><br/></div><div>O Parth, happy are the warriors to whom such opportunities to defend righteousness come unsought, opening for them the stairway to the celestial abodes.</div><div><br/></div><div>If, however, you refuse to fight this righteous war, abandoning your social duty and reputation, you will certainly incur sin.</div><div><br/></div><div>People will speak of you as a coward and a deserter. For a respectable person, infamy is worse than death.</div><div><br/></div><div>you will be freed from the bondage of karma.</div><div><br/></div><div>O Arjun. Rise above the three modes to a state of pure spiritual consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self.</div><div><br/></div><div>You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops attachment to them. Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>What all beings consider as day is the night of ignorance for the wise, and what all creatures see as night is the day for the introspective sage.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.901961); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif, &quot;Gaura Times&quot;, serif; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal;">yajña (sacrifice)</span></div><div><br/></div><hr/><div>Those who do not accept their responsibility in this cycle are sinful; they live only for the delight of their senses, and their lives are in vain.</div><div><br/></div><div>Arjun then asks why people commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force. The Supreme Lord explains that the all-devouring sinful enemy of the world is lust alone. As a fire is covered by smoke, and a mirror is masked by dust, in the same way desire shrouds one’s knowledge and drags away the intellect. Shree Krishna then gives the clarion call to Arjun to slay this enemy called desire, which is the embodiment of sin, and bring his senses, mind, and intellect under control.</div><div><br/></div><div>O sinless one, the two paths leading to enlightenment were previously explained by me: the path of knowledge, for those inclined toward contemplation, and the path of work for those inclined toward action.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Those who restrain the external organs of action, while continuing to dwell on sense objects in the mind, certainly delude themselves and are to be called hypocrites.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">You should also perform your work to set an example for the good of the world. Whatever actions great persons perform, common people follow. Whatever standards they set, all the world pursues.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>The wise should not create discord in the intellects of ignorant people, who are attached to fruitive actions, by inducing them to stop work. Rather, by performing their duties in an enlightened manner, they should inspire the ignorant also to do their prescribed duties.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div>They are released from the bondage of material attachments and their intellect is established in divine knowledge. Since they perform all actions as a sacrifice (to God), they are freed from all karmic reactions.</div><div><br/></div><div>They alone truly see who understand that all actions (of the body) are performed by material nature, while the embodied soul actually does nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is said the fruit of actions performed in the mode of goodness bestow pure results. Actions done in the mode of passion result in pain, while those performed in the mode of ignorance result in darkness.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>The Supreme Lord said: Those who perform prescribed duties without desiring the results of their actions are actual sanyāsīs (renunciates) and yogis, not those who have merely ceased performing sacrifices such as agni-hotra yajña or abandoned bodily activities.</div><div><br/></div><div>The yogis, while giving up attachment, perform actions with their body, senses, mind, and intellect, only for the purpose of self-purification.</div><div><br/></div><div>Those who know the secret of sacrifice, and engaging in it, partake of its remnants that are like nectar, advance toward the Absolute Truth. O best of the Kurus, those who perform no sacrifice find no happiness either in this world or the next.</div><div><br/></div><div>Therefore, giving up attachment, perform actions as a matter of duty, for by working without being attached to the fruits, one attains the Supreme.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>The enlightened sages call those persons wise, whose every action is free from the desire for material pleasures and who have burnt the reactions of work in the fire of divine knowledge.</div></div><div><br/></div><hr/><div>karm-yog is the appropriate option for the majority of humankind. Karm yogis do their worldly duties with purified intellect, abandoning attachment to the fruits of their works, and dedicating them to God.  Thus, they remain unaffected by sin, just as a lotus leaf remains untouched by the water on which it floats.  </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>The karm sanyāsīs perform austerities to control their senses, mind, and intellect.  They shut out all thoughts of external enjoyment and become free from desire, fear, and anger.  Then, consummating their austerities with devotion to God, they attain abiding peace.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Those who dedicate their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin, just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
