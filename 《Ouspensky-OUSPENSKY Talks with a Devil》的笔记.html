"Try to limit yourself, even if it is only a matter of cutting out what you do not need anyway, but which takes most of your time and energy.

And soon, in the distance, you will see the way." </span></div>  </div><div style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; border-top:1px dotted lightgray;"> <div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 8px; border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0); color: #888888;">2018-06-07</div> <div style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>The little devil came out through a locked door at the seashore and, waddling from side to side, he started walking along the sand. A dark wave was running up, leaving behind a line of white foam. The night was warm and dark, almost velvety. The stars were shining, and between the palm trees, like shooting stars, the fireflies were flitting. But the little devil did not pay attention to any of this, for at that moment he suddenly had the look of a rag-and-bone man, some petty hawker considering a cheap deal on the seashore under the palms. What business had he with these palm trees? They could not be cut and sold, and as for the fireflies, they had no market value. If you told a schemer like that that the night was enchanting and <br>beautiful it would seem nonsense to him. </br></span></div>  </div><div style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; border-top:1px dotted lightgray;"> <div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 8px; border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0); color: #888888;">2018-06-07</div> <div style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>He represented the impossibility of becoming aware of anything which holds enchantment or beauty. At this moment, I understood that our gravest mistake is in ascribing to the devil positive evil forces, such as demonic traits. There is nothing positive in the devil nor can there be. This I saw quite clearly. The devil is the absence of all that is highest and most refined in human beings; absence of religious feeling, absence of vision, absence of the feeling for beauty, absence of awareness of the miraculous. </span></div>  </div><div style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; border-top:1px dotted lightgray;"> <div style="font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 8px; border-left: 5px solid rgb(237,108,0); color: #888888;">2018-06-07</div> <div style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>Singhalese</span></div>  </div><div style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:1em"> <hr style="height:2px; border:0; background-color:#ddd;"/> <span style="font-size:10pt; color:gray;">多看笔记 来自多看阅读 for Android</span> </div> </div> </div> <div style="text-align: right; margin-top: -37px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; color: #eeeeee; font-size: 10px;">duokanbookid:u5236499189d3fb9g830842c0fe2bd2d</div></body></html>
