It’s hard. It’s painful. It’s not glossy and doesn’t lend itself to a hashtag or a glib tweet. It will never trend on Twitter. This is not news […] <br/>so if you have a passion and aspire to greatness — if you want to see what you are truly made of, or just how far you can go and what you are truly capable of — forget the hack. <br/>Commit to the daily pressure that compels infinitesimal progress over time. Wake up before dawn and apply yourself in silent anonymity. Practice your craft — in whatever shape or form that may be — late into the evening with relentless rigor. Embrace the fear. Let go of perfection. Allow yourself to fail. Welcome the obstacles. Forget the results. Give yourself over to your passion with every fiber of who you are. And live out the rest of your days trying to do better.”<br/>— <a href="http://www.richroll.com/">Rich Roll</a></div></body></html>
