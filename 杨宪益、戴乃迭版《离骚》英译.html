stolen by his loyal friend.</div><div>The traitor's son, clad in prodigious might,</div><div>In incest sinned and cared not what was right.</div><div>He reveled all his days, forgetting all;</div><div>His head at last in treachery did fall.</div><div>And then the prince, who counsels disobeyed,</div><div>Did court disaster, and his kingdom fade.</div><div>A prince his sage in burning cauldrons tossed;</div><div>His glorious dynasty ere long was lost.</div><div>But stern and pious was their ancient sire,</div><div>And his successor too did faith inspire;</div><div>Exalted were the wise, the able used,</div><div>The rule was kept and never was abused.</div><div>The august heaven, with unbiased grace,</div><div>All men discerns, and helps the virtuous race;</div><div>Sagacious

regret aside.</div><div>Who strove, their tool's defects accounting nought,</div><div>Like ancient sages were to cauldrons brought"</div><div>Thus I despaired, my face with sad tears

darkness wrapped the way;</div><div>The driver of the sun I bade to stay,</div><div>Ere with the setting rays we haste away.</div><div>The way was long, and wrapped in gloom did seem,</div><div>As I urged on to seek my vanished dream.</div><div>The dragons quenched their thirst beside the lake</div><div>Where bathed the sun, whilst I upon the brake</div><div>Fastened my reins; a golden bough I

bird cleared the way;</div><div>The lord of thunder urged me to delay.</div><div>I bade the phoenix scan the heaven wide;</div><div>But vainly day and night its course it tried;</div><div>The gathering whirlwinds drove it from my sight,</div><div>Rushing with lowering clouds to check my flight;</div><div>Sifting and merging in the firmament,</div><div>Above, below, in various hues they went.</div><div>The gate-keeper of heaven I bade give place,</div><div>But leaning on his door he scanned my face;</div><div>The day grew dark, and now was nearly spent;</div><div>Idly my orchids into

should go to grace the loveliest maid.</div><div>The lord of clouds I then bade mount the sky</div><div>To seek the steam where once the nymph did lie;</div><div>As pledge I gave my belt of splendid

lofty crag of jasper green</div><div>The beauteous princess of the west was seen.</div><div>The falcon then I bade entreat the maid,</div><div>But he, demurring, would my course dissuade;</div><div>The turtle-dove cooed soft and off did fly,</div><div>But I mistrusted his frivolity.</div><div>Like whelp in doubt, like timid fox in fear,</div><div>I wished to go, but wandered ever near.</div><div>With nuptial gifts the phoenix swiftly went;</div><div>I feared the prince had won her ere I sent.</div><div>I longed to travel far, yet with no bourn,</div><div>I could but wander aimless and forlorn.</div><div>Before the young king was in marriage bound,</div><div>The royal sisters twain might still be found;</div><div>My plea was weak, my mission was but
