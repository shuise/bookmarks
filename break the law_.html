For all the people arguing this is glorifying breaking the law, it's worth keeping in mind all the people that stood up against segregation in the southern US states, or Apartheid in South Africa, or any number of laws that were considered "immutable" and carried severe penalties.
<div>Yes, these actions are against current laws, but at citizens of the world we have a responsibility to stand up and make our voices heard if we ever hope to change anything. Many people will go to jail and pay big fines in the near future, but that is the way it has always been to influence great change.</div>
