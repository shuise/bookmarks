Many years have passed away and I am looking down from the tower of Notre Dame onto an empty Paris, and the gargoyles are looking down with me . . . You understand, there are no people left, they have vanished long ago, two, three hundred years ago—The <br>bridges are overgrown with grass, and some parts are beginning to fall down. The embankment is crumbling away, the asphalt is cracked, and green bushes and trees are growing in the crevices. The panes of the windows have been broken by the wind or have fallen out. And Notre Dame stands and recalls the past of Paris. The gargoyles talk to each other of all the things they have seen which will never be again; and suddenly they understand that there never has been anything, that they themselves do not exist, and that nothing exists. The moment they understand this, they see people and life again as it was before, and Paris becomes once more the ordinary Paris. But now it is clear to them that neither the people, nor their life—nor the cathedral or the gargoyles themselves really exist ...
