Is the sound of your expression ‘chariot’ itself the chariot?” <br>“No, O Venerable One, the sound of the expression, ‘chariot’ itself is not the chariot.”  </br>“What then, is the chariot, you say you came in? it is an untruth and a falsehood that you, O King, has spoken!

Are you those seven years or are the figures of reckoning those seven years?” Now at that moment the figure of the king, decking in all the finery of his royal ornaments, casts its shadow on the round and was reflected in a large vessel of water. And the Venerable Nāgasena asked him: “Your figure, O King, is now shadowed upon the ground, and reflected in the water, now, O King, may I asked you: “Are you personally, Milinda the king, or the shadow, Milinda the king?” <br>“I am, O venerable Nāgasena, personally, Milinda the king, but he is shadow is not Milinda the king. As a matter of fact the shadow comes into existence because of me.” </br>“Just even so, O King, thenumber of years of Seniority as an ordained monk is seven years, but I am not those weven years, but it is because of me that the number seven has come into existence; and, O King, it is mine in the same sense as the shadow is yours.” </span></div>
